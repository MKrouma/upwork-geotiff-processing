Geotiff data processing for a client from Upwork

## 1. Description 
We are seeking an experienced Python developer to create a specialised service for reading data from GeoTIFF files and performing Line of Sight (LoS) calculations between two geographical points. The primary objective of this task is to develop a Python service that accepts Latitude and Longitude coordinates for two points, extracts elevation data from GeoTIFF files, and returns the elevation information for the specified points as well as all points present in the GeoTIFF file between them.

Key Responsibilities:
1. Utilise Python to read data from GeoTIFF files and extract elevation information.
2. Determine geographical coordinates (Latitude and Longitude) for points A and B using Google Maps.
3. Develop a service that accepts coordinates for points A and B and returns their respective elevations.
4. Implement functionality to identify the correct GeoTIFF file based on the provided coordinates.
5. Calculate the Line of Sight (LoS) between points A and B by considering elevation data from the GeoTIFF file.
6. Ensure the service can handle multiple GeoTIFF files and select the appropriate one based on geographical coordinates.
7. Create robust error handling mechanisms for various scenarios, such as invalid coordinates or missing GeoTIFF files.
8. Utilise open-source libraries for efficient data processing and GeoTIFF file handling.
